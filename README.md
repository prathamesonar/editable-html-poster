# Editable HTML Poster

**This is a web application, built with Next.js and TypeScript, that allows a user to import an HTML file, visually edit its content (text, images, and layout), and export the modified HTML.**

This project was built as a solution for the Frontend Engineer Evaluation Task.

##  Architectural Explanation

This application is built using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. State is managed by **Zustand**, and DOM interactions are handled with **React-Draggable** and **DOMPurify**.

### Core Concepts

1.  **State Management (Zustand):**
    A single global store (`store/useEditorStore.ts`) holds the application state. This includes:
    * `rawHtml`: The original imported HTML string.
    * `bodyContent` / `styleContent`: The parsed and sanitized content for the stage and styles.
    * `selectedElement`: A direct reference to the *live DOM node* currently selected by the user.
    * `stageRef`: A reference to the main `720x720` stage `<div>`.

2.  **Imperative DOM Management (The Stage):**
    The biggest challenge is allowing React to manage the UI *around* a piece of content that is being manipulated directly.
    * The `<Stage>` component uses a `useEffect` hook to set the `innerHTML` of the stage `<div>` *imperatively* when the `bodyContent` (from an import) changes.
    * This prevents React from re-rendering the stage's children and destroying user edits (like moved positions or edited text).

3.  **Element Selection & Editing:**
    * **Selection:** A click listener on the `<Stage>` captures click events, identifies the `e.target`, and saves that `HTMLElement` to the `selectedElement` state. A CSS class (`selected-element-outline`) is applied for the visual outline.
    * **Text Edit:** A double-click listener sets `contentEditable=true` on text elements, allowing for true inline editing. The change is saved directly to the DOM.
    * **Movement:** The `<SelectionOverlay>` component is rendered *on top of* the stage (not *in* it). It uses `react-draggable` and positions itself over the `selectedElement`. On drag-stop, it updates the `selectedElement`'s `style.top` and `style.left` properties, "moving" the real element underneath.

4.  **HTML Import/Export:**
    * **Import:** When HTML is imported (file or paste), it is sanitized using `DOMPurify`. We then use `DOMParser` to find the main content (`.poster`) and the `<style>` block. These are saved to the store, triggering the `Stage` to re-render.
    * **Export:** The `exportHtml` utility (`lib/dom-utils.ts`) reads the `innerHTML` of the `stageRef`, re-wraps it in a full `<html>` document, injects the saved `styleContent`, adds the required `<meta>` tag, and triggers a file download.

---

### SOLID Design Principles

* **S (Single Responsibility Principle):**
    * `useEditorStore`: Manages all application state logic.
    * `Stage.tsx`: Responsible only for rendering the stage, handling clicks, and hosting the overlay.
    * `Toolbar.tsx`: Responsible only for user actions (import, export, add).
    * `PropertiesPanel.tsx`: Responsible only for displaying contextual edit forms.
    * `dom-utils.ts`: Handles the business logic for parsing and exporting HTML.

* **O (Open/Closed Principle):**
    The `PropertiesPanel` is open to extension. To add an editor for `<video>` elements, one could create `VideoProperties.tsx` and add a `case "VIDEO":` to the `switch` statement in `PropertiesPanel` without modifying any other components.

* **D (Dependency Inversion Principle):**
    Components do not depend on each other. The `Toolbar` does not know about the `Stage`. Instead, both depend on the `useEditorStore` abstraction. When the `Toolbar` calls `addElement()`, the store updates, and the `Stage` (which also depends on the store) reacts to the change.

##  Known Limitations & Improvements

* **HTML Parsing:** The current parser is basic. It expects a single `.poster` element (or `body`) and a single `<style>` tag. It will not work well with complex, multi-level HTML documents.
* **Styling:** Only inline styles and a single `<style>` block are supported. External stylesheets (`<link>`) are not fetched or applied.
* **Selection:** The current selection logic selects the *top-level* element inside the stage. Selecting nested elements (like the `<strong>` tag in the example) is not supported.
* **No Undo/Redo:** This is a major feature that is not implemented, as it was listed as optional. This would require a more complex state management system (e.g., storing a history of actions).
* **Basic Properties:** The property editors are basic. A true "poster editor" would have more advanced controls for fonts, shadows, borders, etc.
